# Security Policy

## Supported versions
This repository publishes a minimal set of installer and usage documents. Security issues typically involve:
- instructions that could cause unsafe or unintended actions
- bypasses of explicit safety gating
- misleading claims about tools, persistence, or background work

Only the latest version in `main` is considered supported unless otherwise stated.

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you’ve found a security or safety issue:
1. Prefer GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Reporting / Security Advisories** if available for this repo.
2. If private reporting is not available, email the maintainer (or open an Issue **without sensitive details** and ask for a private channel).

Include:
- a clear description of the issue
- the exact file(s) and section(s) involved
- repro steps (copy/paste prompts if relevant)
- expected vs actual behavior
- impact assessment (what could go wrong)

## What is NOT a security issue
- Requests for new features
- General usage questions
- Cosmetic doc issues

Use Issues for those.
